# Box_of_Colors
In this Project, I have used HTML&amp; CSS to make a container that has 3 rows (using Display Flex). The first row contains 2 boxes, one positioned on the left and the other on the right. In the second row, we have 3 boxes, one on the left and the other on the right, and the last in the center In the third row, we have one box that has a width of 100%.
